# Salmisaari Bikefetcher

Simple cgi-bin python script that outputs the current situation of free bikes at 
the Salmisaari bikestation with a moderately ugly SVG color box with the count.

The script is currently running [here](https://flexer.430am.fi/cgi-bin/bikefetcher.py)
and you can find a graph (data updated every 5 minutes) of last x days [here](https://mronkain.github.io/bikefetcher/).

Requires `pip install svgwrite` and `pip install requests`.
