# Salmisaari Bikefetcher

Simple cgi-bin python script that outputs the current situation of free bikes at 
the Salmisaari bikestation with a moderately ugly SVG color box with the count.

The script is currently running [here](https://flexer.430am.fi/cgi-bin/bikefetcher.py)
and you can find a graph (updated ~hourly) of today's usage [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTdXrLZyz3L73TcLzhbpYgf-heuQsbRYQe0ObTitn6Eg2WQtFTi_LO6AHEiTEXqUcZY91cgQ0xB90Kv/pubchart?oid=1484719611&format=image).

Requires `pip install svgwrite` and `pip install requests`.
