# Salmisaari Bikefetcher

Simple cgi-bin python script that outputs the current situation of free bikes at 
the Salmisaari bikestation with a moderately ugly SVG color box with the count.

The script is currently running [here](https://flexer.430am.fi/cgi-bin/bikefetcher.py)
and you can find a graph (updated ~hourly) of today's usage [here](https://flexer.430am.fi/salmisaari_history/graph.html).

Requires `pip install svgwrite` and `pip install requests`.
